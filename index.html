							<h2>Scientific Rationale</h2>
							<p>Dwarf galaxies are unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation processes and testing key cosmological predictions.
								They are the building blocks of more massive galaxies in the current galaxy formation paradigm, and their relatively
								old and metal poor stellar populations give clues to the formation of first stars and galaxies.
								Despite their low masses, their relatively large dark matter fractions allow us to probe the nature of dark matter on
								small scales. </p>
							<p>Thanks to deep photometric and spectroscopic surveys, our understanding of dwarf galaxies is rapidly evolving. A large number
								of dwarf galaxies have been discovered in recent years, pushing the boundary of the faintest galaxies we know of and raise 
								fundamental questions about the formation of first stars and galaxies in the lowest mass dark matter halos. JWST is also 
								revolutionising the field by providing new data on, and discovery of, the counterparts of these faint objects at higher 
								redshifts. In the coming years, progress will only accelerate due to various upcoming surveys and datasets, such as Rubin 
								Observatory, Roman Space Observatory, WEAVE.   </p>
							<p>On the other hand, theoretical modelling of these galaxies in a cosmological context has been very challenging due to their low mass
								and faint luminosities, and their sensitivities to galaxy formation processes. Despite these challenges, both hydrodynamical 
								simulations and semiempirical+Nbody models have had major advances in recent years allowing more robust predictions about 
								properties of these objects.  </p>
								<hr>
							<p>In this conference, we would like to bring together researchers working on various aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution
								across cosmic time to discuss the recent progress and key open questions and challenges for the upcoming years. In particular,
								we will be covering the following broad areas:
								<ul>
									<li>The role of dwarf galaxies in the formation of Galactic halos. Invited review: Amina Helmi (Groningen) </li>
									<li>Dwarf satellite population in the Local Group. Invited review: Michelle Collins (Surrey)</li>
									<li>Star formation histories, metallicities and stellar populations in dwarf galaxies. Invited review: Alex Ji (Chicago)</li>
									<li>What can dwarf galaxies reveal about the nature of dark matter? Invited review: Ethan Nadler (UC Santa Cruz & Carnegie Obs) </li>
									<li>The interplay between cosmic reionisation and the formation of dwarf galaxies. Invited review: Alejandro Benitez-Llambay (Milan)</li>
									<li>Dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group. Invited review: Shany Danieli (Princeton) </li>
									<li>Dwarf galaxies at higher redshift, advances through JWST. Invited review: Hakim Atek (IAP)</li>
									<li>Upcoming surveys. Invited review: Risa Wechsler (Stanford) </li>
									<li>Wrapping up: pressing questions and future prospects. Invited review: Carlos Frenk (Durham) </li>
								</ul>

							<h3>Wednesday Social Activities</h3>
							<p>We have planned some fun activities for Wednesday afternoon,
								ranging from a stroll through Durham city to basketball/volleyball
								tournaments. Don't forget to pack your sportswear.<br>
								<b>Option 1</b>: Basketball/volleyball tournaments at the Durham University Sports Centre;<br>
								<b>Option 2</b>: A stroll along the river Wear in Durham city, including
								stops at the Cathedral, Oriental Museum and Botanic Garden (all free entrance).
								<a href='images/short_walk_itinerary_june2017.pdf'>Click here for more details</a>;<br>
								<b>Option 3</b>: If weather permits, a guided 5-mile circular walk into the countryside north
								of the Durham city centre and through Aykley Woods Local Nature Reserve
								(<a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/8443735">map</a>).
								<a href='images/long_walk_itinerary_june2017.pdf'>Click here for more details</a>;<br>
								While in Durham, you may consider visiting the Collections Gallery at
								Durham Cathedral, where the Magna Carta will be on display. For more information
								see  the cathedral
